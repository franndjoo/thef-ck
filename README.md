# BrainF*ck Interpreter

**I started to make this BF interpreter in Rust because I felt kinda bored. Right now, it lacks many safety features other interpreters may have.**

You can feel free to bring changes to this repo.

## 🛣️ Roadmap
- [ ] Add safety features on adds and subs to avoid any overflow/outbound related issue.
- [ ] Add a compilation feature by converting a BF file into a set of Assembly instructions.
